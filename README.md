# Box-in-box Linux Sandbox

A Linux sandbox tool that allows unlimited nesting. (**BBL**, short for Box-in-box Linux).

> Early-stage project — free to try and read the code. Note: runtime strings and code comments are currently not in English.

## Overview

An example, the sandbox container tree might look like this:

```
Linux Host {
    X11 (Real Desktop)
    dbus-daemon --session (A) (Real user dbus service)
    fcitx5-daemon (Real Input Method)

    BBL Sandbox {
        Sub-container : Companion Processes : Semi-trusted {
            Xephyr (Isolated X11 Server + Client)
            Xpra client (Seamless Isolated X11 Client)
            dbus-proxy (B) (Filters and forwards dbus, relaying between A and C)
        }
        Sub-container : Untrusted zone {
            Sub-container: User App {
                User apps run here
            }
            Sub-container : Companion Processes {
                Xpra X server (Isolated X11 Server)
                dbus-proxy (C) (Splits and forwards user dbus to internal (D) and external (B))
                dbus-daemon --session (D) (Internal user dbus service)
                dbus-daemon --system (Internal system-level dbus)
                keyring (Internal Keyring Service)
                icewm (Lightweight Window Manager, usually paired with Xephyr)
                kde-plasma (Internally isolated full desktop, usually requires Xephyr)
                fcitx5-daemon (Independent input method for the internal desktop)
            }
        }
    }
}
(Usually not all above will run. It depends on user options)
```

- You can run "untrusted" and "semi-trusted" apps in different layers of one sandbox. Every layer's isolation degree is configurable.

- Arbitrary nesting. Unlike other tools, this tool focus on a smooth sub-namespace nesting experience. You can create a tree of layer-on-layer containers as you like

- Single-file script. Copy as you like, edit options at file head and run. No install. Minimal dependencies.

- Python script although it is, no dependencies on third-party libs. It uses libc to talk to Linux kernel

- No root needed. No daemon. No host cap/suid needed.

- No intentional traces in home or disk. Temp data in `/tmp` deleted automatically

- PID namespace covers children — easy to kill whole sandbox tree.

- Image-free: no container images to download like Docker/LXC. Reuse the host system’s files so tools such as vim or git don’t need to be reinstalled; user data and other paths are isolated.

## Why made this? What about its security?

I call it a Firejail alternative. Firejail/Bubblewrap and even official tool `unshare` don't expose some low-level knobs I want. So I built this fully controllable tool. Nesting to arbitrary depth is out main feature, which other tools don't provide.

Early-stage. It works and you can read the code, but it has not been developed or audited by a security team.

- Xephyr (isolated X11)

## Simple usage examples

In following examples, app processes in sandbox can see only ro system dirs, empty home, and some paths/sockets that user explictly allows. 

**Example 1** — Run AppImage in sandbox

Place a copy of BBL script next to an AppImage of some app you downloaded. 

```
/anyhdd/freecad/bblsbxrun_freecad.py
/anyhdd/freecad/FreeCAD.AppImage
/anyhdd2/projects_save/
```

Edit `.py` file and config like this:
```python
sandbox_name='freecad',
user_mnts = [
    d(mttype='appimage', appname='freecad', src=f'{si.startdir_on_host}/FreeCAD.AppImage'),
    d(mttype='bind', src='/anyhdd2/projects_save/', SDS=1),
],
gui="realX",
```

BBL mounts AppImage contents inside the sandbox so AppImage itself doesn’t need to have FUSE caps. This mounts the AppImage under `/sbxdir/apps/freecad/` inside the sandbox. After launching the sandbox, run `/sbxdir/apps/run_freecad` inside it to start the app.

Project files created by the app can be saved under `/anyhdd2/projects_save/` because that host path was bound into the sandbox. The `SDS` flag means “source and destination are the same” so the directory appears with the same path inside and outside the sandbox.

**Example 2** — running a downloaded binary

If you downloaded an app (for example `firefox.tar.xz`) and want to use the app inside the sandbox:

```
/anyhdd/ffx/bblsbxrun_firefox.py
/anyhdd/ffx/firefox/.... (contains firefox binaries and libraries)
```

Configure:

```python
sandbox_name='firefox', # sandbox name
user_mnts = [
    d(mttype='robind', src=f'{si.startdir_on_host}/firefox', SDS=1), 
    # alternatively, remove SDS and set dist='/sbxdir/apps/firefox'
],
gui="realX",
dbus_session="allow", # input methods and other components need dbus
```

If you want to persist the browser profile, provide a fake home directory next to the script:

```
/anyhdd/ffx/bblsbxrun_firefox.py
/anyhdd/ffx/fakehome
/anyhdd/ffx/firefox/....
```

and configure:

```python
homedir=f'{si.startdir_on_host}/fakehome',
```

The `fakehome` directory will be mounted into the sandbox at the user’s home path.

**Example 3**— use your existing vimrc inside the sandbox

```python
user_mnts = [
    d(mttype='robind', src=f'{si.HOME}/.vimrc', SDS=1), 
],
```
## Sandbox layering model

BBL is a multi-layer, nestable sandbox. The script ships with a default nested template:

```
Linux Host 
  |
 layer1 (management layer; PID isolation; start internal privilege)
  |
 layer2 (semi-trusted zone: mount ns isolation; user global privacy paths masked)
   |
   |--layer2a (drop caps; for trusted companion programs, like xpra client / dbus proxy)
   |
 layer2h (intermediary)
    |
  layer3 (untrusted zone: isolates most namespaces; sees system base paths; only data paths explicitly mounted by user are visible)
    |
    |--layer4 (drop caps; where user apps run)
    |--layer4a (drop caps; for untrusted companion programs, such as xpra server)
```

(layer2a and layer4a are both for companion programs. layer2a can access real X11, real DBus, and host filesystem, while layer4a doesn't need to access them).

**Normal users do not need to edit the default template — only tweak the user options section.**

When the sandbox is started, user app or an interactive user shell (if requested) will usually run at layer4.

> This project is early-stage and the design may change.

A compact template looks like: (for advanced users) 

```python
layer1 = d( # layer 1
    layer_name='layer1', # do not change the default layer_name
    unshare_pid=True, unshare_user=True, ......
    
    sublayers = [
        d( # layer 2
            layer_name='layer2', # do not change the default layer_name
            unshare_pid=True, unshare_mnt=True, ....
            newrootfs=True, fs=[ ..... ], ....
            
            sublayers = [
                d( layer_name='layer2a', .... ),
                d( 
                    layer_name='layer2h', 
                    sublayers = [
                        d( layer_name='layer3', ..... , newrootfs=True, fs=[ ..... ], .....
                            sublayers=[ # layer 4
                                d( layer_name='layer4', .....  , user_shell=True ),
                                d( layer_name='layer4a', ..... ),
                            ],
                        ),
                    ] 
                )
            ],
        )
    ],
)
```

This is only a rough sketch of the default template. For details open the code.

## Startup sequence

Each layer follows this basic flow:

1. Load the layer configuration
1. Call `unshare()` according to the layer configuration
1. `fork()` — the following steps run in the child
1. Temporary privileges escalation or dropping if configured (Write `/proc/self/uid_map` and related files as required) 
1. Build and mount the layer’s new rootfs (if configured)
1. pivot_root into the new rootfs (if configured)
1. Apply configured environment variable changes (if configured)
1. Drop privileges (if configured)
1. Launch a user shell, start sublayers, or run application(s), depending on configuration

> The project is early-stage and the implementation may evolve.

## Filesystem view inside the sandbox

A typical untrusted app’s visible filesystem inside the sandbox is assembled from plan entries like:

```yml
// # system directories read-only from the host
{'plan': 'robind', 'dist': '/bin', 'src': '/bin'}
{'plan': 'robind', 'dist': '/etc', 'src': '/etc'}
{'plan': 'robind', 'dist': '/lib64', 'src': '/lib64'}
.....

// # minimal /dev
{'plan': 'rotmpfs', 'dist': '/dev'}
{'plan': 'bind', 'dist': '/dev/console', 'src': '/dev/console'}
{'plan': 'bind', 'dist': '/dev/null', 'src': '/dev/null'}
{'plan': 'bind', 'dist': '/dev/random', 'src': '/dev/random'}
{'plan': 'devpts', 'dist': '/dev/pts'}
{'plan': 'tmpfs', 'dist': '/dev/shm'}
......

// # temporary writable directories
{'plan': 'tmpfs', 'dist': '/home/username'}
{'plan': 'tmpfs', 'dist': '/run'}
{'plan': 'tmpfs', 'dist': '/run/user/1000'}
{'plan': 'tmpfs', 'dist': '/tmp'}
......

// # user-configured mounts
{'plan': 'appimg-mount', 'src': '/anyhdd/freecad/FreeCAD.AppImage', 'dist': '/sbxdir/apps/freecad'}
{'plan': 'robind', 'src': '/anyhdd/ffx/firefox', 'dist': '/sbxdir/apps/firefox'}
{'plan': 'robind', 'dist': '/tmp/.X11-unix/X0', 'src': '/tmp/.X11-unix/X0'}
{'plan': 'robind', 'dist': '/tmp/dbus_session_socket', 'src': '/run/user/1000/bus'}

// # sandbox configuration directory
{'dist': '/sbxdir'}
```

(These plan entries are included in the default template so users usually don't have to create them manually.)

The `/sbxdir` directory contains:

- AppImage mountpoints (users may need to know about)
- Configuration and metadata for the current layer and its sublayers
- Files used for communication with layer1 and the host
- Scripts used to start sublayers
- Mountpoints for sublayers’ new rootfs
- …
